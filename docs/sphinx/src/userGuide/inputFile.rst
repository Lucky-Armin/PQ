*******
General
*******

The concept of the input file is based on the definition of so-called "commands". A command in the input file can have one of the two following forms and is always case-insensitive:

    1) key = value;
    2) key = [value1, value2, ...];

.. Note::
    The semicolon add the end of both command definitions is necessary, while the number of whitespace can be arbitrary at any position of the command as long as key and value are not split in parts.

Command definition 1) represents a single value command, whereas definition 2) can be considered as a list of input values to which will always be represented with :code:`[]`.

Command Usage
=============

Due to the use of :code:`;` one line of the input file can contain multiple commands and blank lines will be ignored.

Comments
========

Every character following a :code:`#` will be ignored. The :code:`#` as a comment flag can be used also in all setup files - with some exceptions when contiguous input blocks are necessary.

Types of Input Values
=====================

In the following sections the types of the input values will be denoted via :code:`{}`, where :code:`{[]}` represents a list of types:

+-------------+-------------------------------+
|    Type     |          Description          |
+=============+===============================+
|   {int}     |            integer            |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|  {uint+}    |       positive integers       |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|   {uint}    | positive integers including 0 |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|  {double}   |    floating point numbers     |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|  {string}   |              \-               |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|   {file}    |              \-               |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|   {path}    |              \-               |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
| {pathFile}  |     equal to {path/file}      |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
|   {bool}    |          true/false           |
+-------------+-------------------------------+
| {selection} |          selection            |
+-------------+-------------------------------+

.. _selectionType:

.. Note::
    The :code:`{selection}` type is used to select a specific atom or group of atoms. If the PQ software package was build including :code:`python3.12` dependencies, the user can apply the selection grammar defined in the `PQAnalysis package <https://molarverse.github.io/PQAnalysis/code/PQAnalysis.topology.selection.html>`_. However, if PQ was compiled without these dependencies it is possible to index *via* the atomic indices starting from 0. If more than one atom index should be selected, the user can give a list of indices like :code:`{0, 1, 2}`. If a range of atom indices should be selected the user can use the following syntax :code:`{0-5, 10-15}` or :code:`{0..5, 10-15}` or :code:`{0..5, 10..15}`, where all would be equivalent to :code:`{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}`.

Input Keys
==========

.. Note::
    Some of the following keys are necessary in the input file and are therefore marked with a :code:`*`. If there exists a default value for the possible options related to a key, they will be marked with :code:`->` after the command.

General Output Keys
===================

.. Note::
    The PQ application has a special naming convention for output files. For every job type a certain set of output files is written per default. If no output file names are given all prefixes of the output files will be named :code:`default.<ext>`. If at least one of the output file keys was given in the input file - the program will determine the most common prefix (*i.e.* string before the first :code:`.` character) and set it with the respective extension for all unspecified output files.

    This feature enables easier post-processing of data and also easier deletion of all output files as PQ does not overwrite any existing output files and will throw an error.

QM_SCRIPT
=========

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_script = {file}

With the :code:`qm_script` keyword the external executable to run the QM engine and to parse its output is chosen. All possible scripts can be found under `<https://github.com/MolarVerse/PQ/tree/main/src/QM/scripts>`_. Already the naming of the executables should hopefully be self-explanatory in order to choose the correct input executable name.

QM_SCRIPT_FULL_PATH
===================

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_script_full_path = {pathFile}

.. attention::
   This keyword can not be used in conjunction with the :code:`qm_script` keyword! Furthermore, this keyword needs to be used in combination with any singularity or static build of PQ. For further details regarding the compilation/installation please refer to the :ref:`userG_installation` section.



With the :code:`qm_script_full_path` keyword the user can specify the full path to the external executable to run the QM engine and to parse its output. All possible scripts can be found under `<https://github.com/MolarVerse/PQ/tree/main/src/QM/scripts>`_. Already the naming of the executables should hopefully be self-explanatory in order to choose the correct input executable name.

QM_LOOP_TIME_LIMIT
==================

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_loop_time_limit = {double} s -> -1 s

With the :code:`qm_loop_time_limit` keyword the user can specify the loop time limit in :code:`s` of all QM type calculations. If the time limit is reached the calculation will be stopped. Default value is -1 s, which means no time limit is set, and the calculation will continue until it is finished. In general all negative values will be interpreted as no time limit.

QM_Center
=========

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_center = {selection} -> 0

With the :code:`qm_center` keyword the user can specify the center of the QM region. The default selection is the first atom of the system (*i.e.* 0). For more information about the selection grammar see the `selectionType`_ section. The :code:`qm_center` if more than one atom is selected will be by default the center of mass of the selected atoms.

QM_Only_List
============

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_only_list = {selection}

With the :code:`qm_only_list` keyword the user can specify a list of atoms which should be treated as QM atoms only. This means that these atoms can not leave the QM region during the simulation. For more information see the reference manual. For more information about the selection grammar see the `selectionType`_ section. By default no atom is selected.

MM_Only_List
============

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    mm_only_list = {selection}

With the :code:`mm_only_list` keyword the user can specify a list of atoms which should be treated as MM atoms only. This means that these atoms can not enter the QM region during the simulation. For more information see the reference manual. For more information about the selection grammar see the `selectionType`_ section. By default no atom is selected.

QM_Charges
==========

.. admonition:: Key
    :class: tip

    qm_charges = {string} -> "off"

With the :code:`qm_charges` keyword the user can specify the charge model for the QM atoms. If the :code:`qm_charges` keyword is set to :code:`off` the charges of the QM atoms are taken from the MM model applied. If the :code:`qm_charges` keyword is set to :code:`on` the charges of the QM atoms are taken from the QM calculation.
